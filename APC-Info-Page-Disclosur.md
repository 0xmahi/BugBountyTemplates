# APC info page disclosure 

## Summary
The Alternative PHP Cache (APC) is a PHP extension that provides _opcode caching_. By caching the compiled operation codes (opcodes) of PHP scripts, APC enables sites to serve page content significantly faster. 

## URLs

- $URL

## Impact

An attacker can obtain information such as:

Operating system **(Ubuntu)**
PHP Version **(5.3.10-1ubuntu3.26)**
Host local IP  **()**
Server Software **(Apache/2.2.22)**
APC version **(3.1.7)**

This information can help an attacker gain more information on the system. After gaining detailed information, the attacker can research known vulnerabilities for that system under review. The attacker can also use this information during the exploitation of other vulnerabilities.
