## Summary

API keys have some security configurations for blocking unauthorized usage for malicious people which does **not** comes by default. 
Developers need to configure this security controls within their own decisions. While these API keys are designed as public API keys and does not have any impact in terms of customer data confidentiality/integrity, this security configurations still need to be implemented for blocking unauthorized usage.


## Steps To Reproduce

 1. Go to this [URL]($URL)
 2. Find in source code for the API Key $KEY 
 3. Use the API in the following ways (exploit):
	 a. [Google Maps](https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/staticmap?center=45%2C10&zoom=7&size=400x400&key=$KEY)

I did 1,000 requests of the API Key using Burp Intruder. (screenshot)

Request used:
```
