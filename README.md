# bugBountyTemplates

List of templates I had use since I started doing BBH. 

Not all templates would work to every case, even with the same site. For example, some programs in HackerOne have a diffent order and some have more fields. (Yes, I'm talking about you DOD). 

If you have some templates not found here, please create a PR. 

I manage my templtes on http://stackedit.io, but now I'm moving to automate the entire process, having them in a git hub repo will help me with the entire process.
