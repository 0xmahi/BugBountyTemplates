#  Apache vulnerable to CVE-2020-11993

## Summary

It's possible to obtain the version of some Apache servers in the Response Header for a GET Request.

Just run `curl -v -k $URL`   and check for `server: $VERSION`.

The version $APACHE_VERSION is vulnerable to server crash using a specially crafted value for the 'Cache-Digest' header in a HTTP/2 request would result in a crash when the server actually tries to HTTP/2 PUSH a resource afterwards. [CVE-2020-9490](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-9490)

## Affected assets

2 Use the following [POC] (https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/attachmentText?aid=443369)
3 Execute the code with one of the servers. [I didn't do it, don't want any of your servers to crash]
