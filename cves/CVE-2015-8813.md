## SSRF due to CVE-2015-8813

The Page_Load function in Umbraco.Web/umbraco.presentation/umbraco/dashboard/FeedProxy.aspx.cs in Umbraco before 7.4.0 allows remote attackers to conduct server-side request forgery (SSRF) attacks via the url parameter.

``curl -k $URL``

Several ping backs are received, HTTP and DNS requests:


## Impact

An SSRF exploit that causes connections to external third-party systems might result in malicious onward attacks that appear to originate from the organization hosting the vulnerable application, leading to potential legal liabilities and reputational damage.
