# Information disclosure via /debug/pprof

## Summary

The debugging endpoint /debug/pprof is exposed over the unauthenticated Kubelet healthz port. The go pprof endpoint is exposed over the Kubelet's healthz port. This debugging endpoint can potentially leak sensitive information such as internal Kubelet memory addresses and configuration, or for limited denial of service. Versions prior to 1.15.0, 1.14.4, 1.13.8, and 1.12.10 are affected. 

## Steps To Reproduce

 - Go to  https://$DOMAIN/debug/pprof/
     Check
 - https://$DOMAIN/debug/pprof/goroutine?debug=2
 - https://$DOMAIN/debug/pprof/goroutine?debug=1
 - https://$DOMAIN/debug/pprof/allocs?debug=1 		
 - https://$DOMAIN/debug/pprof/heap?debug=1

## Impact
-   Function names and file paths are revealed.
-   Profiling data may reveal business sensitive information (for example traffic to a web server)
-   Profiling degrades performance, providing a vector for a DoS attack.
